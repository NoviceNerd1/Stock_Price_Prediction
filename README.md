###Stock Price Prediction
This repository contains a project focused on predicting stock prices using historical data and machine learning techniques. The main goal is to build a predictive model that can forecast future stock prices based on past performance. This project uses the NSE (National Stock Exchange) data for Tata Global Beverages Limited and employs a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to make the predictions.

##Project Overview
#Key Features:
Data Preprocessing:

Reads stock data from a CSV file.
Converts the date column to datetime format and sets it as the index.
Normalizes the data using MinMaxScaler to scale the features between 0 and 1.
Visualization:

Plots the historical closing prices to provide a visual understanding of the stock performance over time.
Model Building:

Constructs an LSTM model using Keras.
The model is trained on the historical stock data to learn patterns and make predictions.
Prediction:

Uses the trained LSTM model to predict stock prices.
Visualizes the predicted stock prices alongside the actual prices for comparison.
Deployment:

Implements a web application using Dash to provide an interactive interface for users to visualize actual and predicted stock prices.
